LAYOUT - http://smacss.com/book/type-layout
"There is a distinction between layouts dictating the major and minor components of a page. The minor components—such
 as a callout, or login form, or a navigation item—sit within the scope of major components such as a header or footer.
 I refer to the minor components as Modules and will dive into those in the next section. The major components are
 referred to as Layout styles.

 Layout styles can also be divided into major and minor styles based on reuse. Major layout styles such as header and
 footer are traditionally styled using ID selectors but take the time to think about the elements that are common
 across all components of the page and use class selectors where appropriate.

 Some sites may have a need for a more generalized layout framework (for example, 960.gs). These minor Layout styles
 will use class names instead of IDs so that the styles can be used multiple times on the page.

 Generally, a Layout style only has a single selector: a single ID or class name. However, there are times when a
 Layout needs to respond to different factors. For example, you may have different layouts based on user preference.
 This layout preference would still be declared as a Layout style and used in combination with other Layout styles."
